<h1>Revelation</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>


<p>We make ourselves a place apart<br> 
&nbsp Behind light words that tease and flout,<br> 
But oh, the agitated heart<br>
&nbsp Till someone find us really out.<br></p>

<p>'Tis pity if the case require<br>
&nbsp (Or so we say) that in the end<br> 
We speak the literal to inspire<br> 
&nbsp The understanding of a friend.<br> </p>

<p>But so with all, from babes that play<br>
&nbsp At hide-and-seek to God afar,<br> 
So all who hide too well away<br> 
&nbsp Must speak and tell us there they are.<br>
</p>
